### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,

- At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ModuleListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

- executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
- keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Module` objects residing in the `Model`.
- keeps a reference to the current screen state as a `GuiState` in order to restrict some commands to certain screens (more on this under `Restricting Commands based on GUI state` in the `Implementation` section below).
- changes the screen based on the return value of CommandResult.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How to change UI screen based on the command**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Create card classes for each type of screen and change rendered card based on return value of CommandResult.
    * Pros: Readability is enhanced, easily extendable.
    * Cons: Coupling of UI component is reduced; logic needs to be added to CommandResult to change the current screen.
* **Alternative 2**: Have a single rendered ModuleCard that changes text based on the type of the object in the ObservableList.
    * Pros: Easier to implement.
    * Cons: Harder to extend; can lead to a monolithic ModuleCard that handles all views.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `ModBookParser` class to parse the user command together with the current state of the GUI (`GuiState`).
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddModCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a module).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete mod 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete mod 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

- When called upon to parse a user command, the `ModBookParser` class creates a `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `DetailCommand`) which the `ModBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
- The name of the `Command` Object may also include the type of object the command is acting on. For example, `delete mod` command returns  a `deleteModCommand` object, `delete lesson` command returns a `deleteLessonCommand` object and `delete exam` command returns a `deleteExamCommand` object.
- All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

- stores the address book data i.e., all `Module` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueModuleList` object).
- stores the currently 'selected' `Module` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Module>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
- does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)


![StorageClassDiagram](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

The `Storage` component,

* can save both module data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `ModBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

The sequence diagram of how this works for an `add lesson` command is found below. The objects in `Model` and `UI`, as well as time-related objects, are omitted for simplicity.

![StorageSequenceDiagram](images/StorageSequenceDiagram.png)

When storing the `ModBook`, the respective `JsonAdaptedObject` classes will create adaptations of objects in the `Model`, allowing `JsonUtil` to store the objects and save them to the `filePath` specified in `UserPrefs`.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How to save components of Modules (Lesson / Exam / Timeslot / ModBookTime / ModBookDate):**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Create respective `JsonAdaptedObject` classes for each type of object.
    * Pros: Greatly increases the readability of the JSON storage file
    * Cons: Many objects must be created when a Lesson or Exam is being stored.
* **Alternative 2**: Encode `Lesson`, `Exam` and other components into `String` objects to be stored as properties of a `JsonAdaptedModule`.
    * Pros: Easier to implement the writing of JSON files.
    * Cons: Difficult to parse JSON output - have to figure out how to decode `String` objects to `Lesson`, `Exam` and other objects in the `Model`.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Restricting Commands based on GUI state

#### Rationale

Some commands, e.g. `delete lesson` and `edit exam` should not be used in the view where the `Modules` are listed.
This is because the `delete` and `edit` commands are indexed based, and in the `Modules` view, there are multiple `Lesson`s or `Exam`s displayed with the same index.
Hence, there is a need to restrict these commands to the Module Details view, so that there is no ambiguity about which `Lesson` or `Exam` to delete.

Thus, before commands are executed, the GUI state of the application needs to be checked to see if it is valid.

#### Implementation

To implement this feature, the GUI needs to keep track of which state it is in, so a field in `MainWindow` was created to store the `GuiState`.
In addition, the `Logic#execute()` method has an additional `GuiState` parameter, which will be the current `GuiState` of the `MainWindow`, and the `Parser` interface was modified so that `parse` also takes in a `GuiState` parameter.
After the command is executed, the `GuiState` of the `MainWindow` is updated with the `GuiState` of the returned `CommandResult`.

The class diagram of how UI and Logic interact with each other is shown below.

![LogicGuiStateClassDigram](images/LogicGuiStateClassDiagram.png)

The sequence diagram of how this works for a `delete` command is found below. The objects in `Model` and `Storage` are not shown for simplicity.

![GuiStateSequenceDiagram](images/GuiStateSequenceDiagram.png)

When parsing, the respective `Parser` will check the current `GuiState` with the allowed `GuiState`s. If the `GuiState` is valid, it will proceed with parsing the command.
Otherwise, it will throw a `GuiStateException`.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How to implement edit/delete lessons/exams:**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Limits these two commands to the Module Details view.
  - Pros: Easier to implement.
  - Cons: Requires passing `GuiState` from the `UI` component to the `Logic` component, reducing cohesion.
- **Alternative 2**: Combine the lists of lessons and exams into one central list in the List Lessons or Exams view respectively.
  - Pros: Does not require `MainWindow` to keep track of its current `GuiState`.
  - Cons: Difficult to implement - have to figure out how to map the `Lesson` or `Exam` from the central list to its original module.
